# Tradeshift

## Class
I created a triangle class to store the lengths of the triangle. The class can hold the 3 lengths and includes a method to calculate the type of triangle.

The benefit of making a class is if the domain was more complex it would allow for more methods to calculate things about the triangle.

The class could easily be expanded to include other fields about a triangle, for example angles and maybe a method to calculate a missing angle.

I also considered making a static method for calculating the type, but that would not be the best approach for a more complex domain.

## Test
I wrote the test first to help get a clear image of what output i expected depending on the input.

I have written test that hit all 3 types of triangles and also 2 test for the 2 types of exeptions, so I know that everything is handled correctly.
